# Intro_to_Software_Development_Java
Final Project Java


This application let students get registered for classes.
If a new student wants to get registered, this applications assigns then courses and teachers to help them build a schedule.
Also if the student has preferences on which classes they want to take, this application priorotizes that factor and assign them those courses and
teachers according to their availability.
This applications also keeps a record of the exsisting students so there is no double registration in the system.

I hope this sums it up.
